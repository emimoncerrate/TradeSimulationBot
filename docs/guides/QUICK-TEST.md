# ðŸ”§ Quick Test Instructions

## What Was Fixed:
1. âœ… **Removed duplicate `/trade` command registrations**
2. âœ… **Fixed async handler issue** - now uses sync handler with async execution in thread
3. âœ… **Proper acknowledgment** - prevents timeout errors

## Test Steps:
1. **Restart the app**: `python3 app.py`
2. **Look for these logs**:
   ```
   âœ… Enhanced trade command created successfully
   âœ… Enhanced /trade command with live market data registered successfully
   ```
3. **In Slack, type**: `/trade AAPL`
4. **Expected Result**: Modal opens with live market data (not text response)

## If It Works:
- âœ… You'll see a **modal popup** with live AAPL data
- âœ… Interactive buttons will work
- âœ… Auto-refresh toggle available
- âœ… Real-time market data display

## If Still Not Working:
- Check logs for any new error messages
- Try `/trade` without parameters
- Verify the slash command is registered in Slack app settings

The async issue should now be resolved! ðŸš€

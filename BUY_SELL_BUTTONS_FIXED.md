# 🔧 Buy/Sell Button Handlers - FIXED!

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Action Handlers Now Working

The buy/sell button handlers were failing due to improper `ack()` calls in async functions. This has been **completely fixed**!

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

### Problem:
```python
@app.action("buy_shares")
async def handle_buy_shares(ack, body, client, context):
    ack()  # ❌ Wrong - not awaited in async function
```

### Error in Logs:
```
Unhandled request ({'type': 'block_actions', 'action_id': 'buy_shares'})
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'handle_buy_shares' was never awaited
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Solution Applied:
```python
@app.action("buy_shares")
async def handle_buy_shares(ack, body, client, context):
    await ack()  # ✅ Correct - properly awaited
```

### Files Fixed:
1. **`listeners/actions.py`**:
   - ✅ `handle_buy_shares` - Fixed `await ack()`
   - ✅ `handle_sell_shares` - Fixed `await ack()`
   - ✅ `process_action` - Fixed `await ack()`

2. **`listeners/commands.py`**:
   - ✅ `process_command` - Fixed `await ack()`

3. **`listeners/events.py`**:
   - ✅ `handle_refresh_dashboard` - Fixed `await ack()`

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

# Risk Alert Permissions Change

## ✅ **Change Applied**

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Change:** Removed role-based restrictions for risk alert creation

---

## 🔓 **What Changed**

### **Before:**
- Only **Portfolio Managers** and **Admins** could create risk alerts
- Other users received error: "❌ Only Portfolio Managers and Admins can create risk alerts."

### **After:**
- **ALL users** can now create risk alerts
- No role checking performed
- Anyone with access to the Slack workspace can use `/risk-alert`

---

## 📝 **Technical Details**

### **File Modified:**
- `listeners/risk_alert_handlers.py`

### **Lines Changed:**
Lines 58-67 in `handle_risk_alert_command()`

**Original Code:**
```python
user = await db_service.get_user_by_slack_id(command['user_id'])

if not user or user.role not in [UserRole.PORTFOLIO_MANAGER, UserRole.ADMIN]:
    await client.chat_postEphemeral(
        channel=command['channel_id'],
        user=command['user_id'],
        text="❌ Only Portfolio Managers and Admins can create risk alerts."
    )
    return
```

**New Code:**
```python
# TEMPORARY: Allow all users to create risk alerts (no role restriction)
# TODO: Re-enable role-based restrictions later if needed
# user = await db_service.get_user_by_slack_id(command['user_id'])
# if not user or user.role not in [UserRole.PORTFOLIO_MANAGER, UserRole.ADMIN]:
#     await client.chat_postEphemeral(
#         channel=command['channel_id'],
#         user=command['user_id'],
#         text="❌ Only Portfolio Managers and Admins can create risk alerts."
#     )
#     return
```

## 🔄 **To Re-enable Restrictions Later**

If you want to restore role-based restrictions:

1. Open `listeners/risk_alert_handlers.py`
2. Find lines 58-67
3. Uncomment the role check code:
   - Remove the `#` from the beginning of each line
   - Remove the "TEMPORARY" comment
4. Restart the app

---

## 🎯 **Impact**

### **Commands Affected:**
- ✅ `/risk-alert` - Anyone can create alerts
- ✅ `/risk-alerts` - Anyone can view their own alerts

### **What Still Works:**
- Each user can only see/manage their own alerts
- Alert notifications go to the user who created the alert
- Database isolation per user (manager_id field)

### **Security Considerations:**
- All Slack workspace members can create alerts
- Consider channel-based restrictions if needed
- Monitor alert creation volume
- Review alert data for sensitive information

---

## 📊 **Current User Experience**

Any user can now:
1. Type `/risk-alert` in any channel
2. See the risk alert configuration modal
3. Set parameters:
   - Minimum trade size ($)
   - Loss threshold (%)
   - VIX threshold
4. Receive notifications when trades match criteria
5. View and manage their alerts with `/risk-alerts`

---

## ⚠️ **Notes**

- This is marked as **TEMPORARY** in the code
- Code comments indicate this can be re-enabled later
- Original role-checking logic is preserved (just commented out)
- No database schema changes required

---

## 🔧 **Testing After Change**

Test with different user types:
```bash
# Any user in Slack workspace
/risk-alert
# Should see: Risk alert configuration modal

/risk-alerts  
# Should see: List of user's own alerts
```

Expected result: **All users** can access both commands successfully.

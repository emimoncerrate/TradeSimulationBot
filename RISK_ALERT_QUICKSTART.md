## üìä What Gets Monitored

### Trade Metrics Checked:

1. **Trade Size**
   ```
   Trade Size = Quantity √ó Price
   Example: 1000 shares √ó $150 = $150,000
   ```

2. **Loss Percentage**
   ```
   For BUY: Loss % = (Entry Price - Current Price) / Entry Price √ó 100
   For SELL: Loss % = (Current Price - Entry Price) / Entry Price √ó 100
   ```

3. **VIX Level**
   ```
   Current VIX volatility index
   Fetched in real-time from market data
   Cached for 5 minutes
   ```

### Alert Triggers When:
```
trade_size >= threshold AND
loss_percent >= threshold AND
vix_level >= threshold
```

All three conditions must be met!

## üéØ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: I want to monitor large trades only

```yaml
Trade Size: $1,000,000  # High threshold
Loss %: 0               # Any loss/gain
VIX: 0                  # Any volatility
```

### Scenario 2: I want alerts during high volatility

```yaml
Trade Size: $100,000    # Moderate threshold
Loss %: 3               # 3%+ loss
VIX: 30                 # High volatility
```

### Scenario 3: I want to monitor a specific risk level

```yaml
Trade Size: $250,000    # Specific threshold
Loss %: 5               # 5%+ loss
VIX: 20                 # Elevated volatility
```

### Scenario 4: I want comprehensive monitoring

```yaml
Trade Size: $50,000     # Low threshold (catches most)
Loss %: 2               # 2%+ loss
VIX: 15                 # Moderate volatility
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Alert not triggering?

**Check 1:** Is alert ACTIVE?
```
/risk-alerts
Look for ‚úÖ (active) not ‚è∏Ô∏è (paused)
```

**Check 2:** Are ALL three criteria met?
- Trade size must be ‚â• threshold
- Loss % must be ‚â• threshold  
- VIX must be ‚â• threshold

**Check 3:** Is "Monitor new trades" enabled?
- Must be checked when creating alert
- Check alert settings in `/risk-alerts`

### Not receiving notifications?

**Check 1:** Verify Slack DM settings
- Ensure DMs are enabled
- Check notification preferences

**Check 2:** Check app logs
```bash
tail -f jain_global_slack_trading_bot.log | grep "alert"
```

**Check 3:** Test with low thresholds
- Create alert with all thresholds at 0
- Execute any trade
- Should get notification immediately

### Integration failing?

**Option 1:** Run integration script again
```bash
python3 scripts/integrate_risk_alerts.py
```

**Option 2:** Manual integration
- Follow `RISK_ALERT_INTEGRATION.md`
- Check each step carefully

**Option 3:** Check logs
```bash
# Look for integration errors
grep -i "risk.*alert" jain_global_slack_trading_bot.log
```
